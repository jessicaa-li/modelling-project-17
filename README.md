# CISC/CMPE 204 Modelling Project

Our project aims to use the logic of Pokémon type effectiveness to build the player an ideal Pokémon team that best counters the team of their opponent. When given the type(s) of the foe's Pokémon, the model will return the Pokémon type(s) that will best counter it. This means that a Pokémon of the returned type(s), or a Pokémon with moves of the returned type(s), should be added to the player's team.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
